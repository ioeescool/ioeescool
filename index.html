		<p>My best subjects would be Mathematics, French, and Tech.</p>
		<p>Moving out of my academic life, I also had a pet tuxedo cat named Satu. If I had the choice,<br>I will also get a new cat in the future, as cats are my favourite animal.</p>
		<p>Countries I've been to so far include <a href=https://www.canada.ca/en.html>Canada</a>, <a href=https://www.usa.gov/>The United States</a>, and <a href=https://english.www.gov.cn/>China</a>.</p><img src=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/Flag_of_Canada_%28Pantone%29.svg/960px-Flag_of_Canada_%28Pantone%29.svg.png align=right width=400px>
		<p>Some things I want to do in the future include eventually becoming a game developer as a future career,<br>
		visiting every national park in Canada, travelling around the world, and becoming fluent in French.</p>
		<p>I live in Toronto, Canada, which is why I attend schools in the Toronto District School Board. <br> While I will not disclose the specific location of my residence due to privacy reasons, <br> I will say that I live quite far from my school.</p>
		<p>My siblings include an older sister and a younger brother. I live with only my parents, as my grandparents and other extended family members live in China.</p>
